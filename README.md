# E-Commerce Shoe Website

Welcome to the E-Commerce Shoe Website!

This project is a fully functional online store dedicated to shoes, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website offers a variety of shoe products categorized by type, brand, and style, providing users with a seamless shopping experience. Users can browse through the catalog, view detailed product descriptions and images, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout securely. The design is responsive, ensuring optimal display and functionality across different devices, from desktops to smartphones.

This project showcases my skills in front-end web development, focusing on creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface for e-commerce. Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactive elements such as product filtering, cart management, and checkout processes, I've built a robust platform that meets the needs of both customers and administrators. Whether you're shopping for athletic shoes, casual footwear, or formal wear, the E-Commerce Shoe Website offers a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience tailored for shoe enthusiasts
